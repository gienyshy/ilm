## Code for "Infilling by Language Modeling" (ILM)

This repository will soon house the code for the ILM framework outlined in the ACL 2020 paper _Enabling language models to fill in the blanks_ (Donahue et al. 2020).

You can explore a web demo of our infilling models at <a href="https://chrisdonahue.com/ilm" target="_blank">chrisdonahue.com/ilm</a>. Demo code is available on the `demo` branch.

Full training/evaluation code will be released by **June 19th, 2020**.
