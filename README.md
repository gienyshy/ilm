## Code for "Infilling via Language Modeling" (ILM)

This repository will soon house the code for the ILM framework outlined in the ACL 2020 paper _Enabling language models to fill in the blanks_ (Donahue et al. 2020).

Code will be released by **June 19th, 2020**.

The frontend code for the <a href="https://chrisdonahue.com/ilm/">submission version of our demo</a> can be found on the `gh-pages` branch. An updated demo will be released alongside the code.
